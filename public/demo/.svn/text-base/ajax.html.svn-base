            This is a "vanilla plain" jqModal window. Behavior and appeareance extend far beyond this.
            The demonstrations on this page will show off a few possibilites. I recommend walking
            through each one to get an understanding of jqModal <em>before</em> using it.

            <br /><br />
            You can view the sourcecode of examples by clicking the Javascript, CSS, and HTML tabs.
            Be sure to checkout the <a href="README">documentation</a> too!

            <br /><br />
            <em>NOTE</em>; You can close windows by clicking the tinted background known as the "overlay".
            Clicking the overlay will have no effect if the "modal" parameter is passed, or if the
            overlay is disabled.
